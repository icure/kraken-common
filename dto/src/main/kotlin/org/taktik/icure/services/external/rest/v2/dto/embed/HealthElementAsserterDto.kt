/**
 * The party asserting that the patient has the healthcare element this asserter is attached to.
 *
 * This is the FHIR-style *asserter* concept: it does not say who recorded or authored the healthcare element, it says
 * on whose word the healthcare element is held to be true. A patient may self-report an allergy, a family member may
 * report a condition on behalf of the patient, and a physician may assert a diagnosis: all three are asserters, and the
 * same healthcare element may carry more than one of them.
 *
 * The party is named in exactly one of two ways, and exactly one of the two fields must be set:
 * - [localAsserterIdentifier] names a party stored in this iCure instance: an id, plus the [AsserterTypeDto] saying
 *   which kind of record that id points at;
 * - [externalAsserterIdentifier] names a party that has no record here, through a business [IdentifierDto] issued by
 *   another system. There is deliberately no [AsserterTypeDto] on this branch: the kind of a record we do not store is
 *   not knowable to us.
 *
 * The exactly-one rule is **not** checked on this DTO. It is checked one layer down, in `HealthElementAsserter`'s
 * `init`: mapping this DTO constructs one, so a violation still surfaces as a `400`, and the rule also covers the write
 * paths that never build a DTO at all. This class only checks that [LocalAsserterIdentifier.id] is not blank. Nothing
 * enforces the *pairing* inside [LocalAsserterIdentifier]: [AsserterTypeDto] bounds the vocabulary, not what
 * [LocalAsserterIdentifier.id] actually points at; that invariant is owned by the SDK.
 *
 * Note on organisations: an organisation (hospital, practice, care home, ...) is not a distinct asserter type.
 * Organisations are stored as healthcare party records, distinguished from individual practitioners by tags set by the
 * client, so an organisation asserter is a [localAsserterIdentifier] with `type = AsserterTypeDto.healthcareParty`
 * whose `id` points to such a record. The association between a practitioner and the organisation they were acting for
 * at the time of the assertion is deliberately NOT modelled here.
