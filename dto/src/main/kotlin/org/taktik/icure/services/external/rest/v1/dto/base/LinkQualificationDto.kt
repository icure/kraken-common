/**
 * The qualification of a link between two concepts
 *
 * - [narrower] means that the linked codes have a narrower interpretation
 * - [parent] means that the linked code(s) is the parent of this code
 * - [sequence] means that the linked codes are a sequence of codes that are part of the current code
 * - [basedOn] means a plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event. For example, a MedicationRequest may require a patient to have laboratory test performed before it is dispensed.
 * - [derivedFrom] means the target resource that represents a measurement from which the service value is derived. For example, a calculated anion gap or a fetal measurement based on an ultrasound image.
 * - [device] means the device used to generate the service data
 * - [focus] means the actual focus of a service when it is not the patient of record representing something or someone associated with the patient such as a spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. For example, fetus observations in a mother's record.
 * - [hasMember] means this service is a group service (e.g. a battery, a panel of tests, a set of vital sign measurements) that includes the target as a member of the group
 * - [performer] means who was responsible for asserting the observed value as "true".
 * - [specimen] means the specimen that was used when this service was made
 * - [request] why the specimen was collected
 *
 * When creating a link, we encourage creating single direction links. The reverse link can be found through a view
 *
 * Favour parent over child as it is better (for conflicts) to change 5 different documents once instead of changing 5 times the same document
