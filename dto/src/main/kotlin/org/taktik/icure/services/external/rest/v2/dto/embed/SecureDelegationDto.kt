@Schema(description = """Represents a delegation which allows a data owner to access the encrypted data of an entity and specifies his access control level.
The encrypted  metadata is created by a "delegator" data owner, and can be used also by a "delegate" data owner. To create new
[SecureDelegation] the "delegate" and "delegator" data owners must have created some [ExchangeData]: their [ExchangeData.exchangeKey]
is used for the encryption of the content of this delegation, while its [ExchangeData.accessControlSecret] is used for creating the key
of [SecurityMetadata.secureDelegations].
New [SecureDelegation] will be created in two situations:
- When a data owner creates a new entity he will also add [SecureDelegation] where he is both delegator and delegate.
- When a data owner wants to share an entity with another data owner he will create new [SecureDelegation] where he
is the delegator and the other data owner is the delegate.
## Optionally explicit delegator and delegate
The [SecureDelegation] can optionally include explicitly the id of the [delegator] and [delegate] data owners using the
respective fields:
- When the id of a data owner is explicit the server can know at any moment which users have access to which data. This
allows to more easily search for all data that a specific user can access, as access control rights can be checked easily
by the server. At the same time, however, this could break confidentiality of the data, because for example knowing that
a patient has access to some medical data means that the data is likely about that patient or a close relative, and if
the data includes some unencrypted codes this may leak medical information for the patient.
- When the id of a data owner is not explicit the data owner will have to know beforehand the access control key to be used
for access control, as the server does not have a way of knowing who is the delegator and/or delegate of the secure delegation.
A user with only a few instances of exchange data can easily load all his access control keys and pass them to the api method,
but this may not be possible for hcps, as they could have exchange data with many of their patients.
In general users will want to hide the delegator/delegate id for patient and medical devices data owners, in order to keep
data confidentiality. For hcps instead the best choice depends is likely to change depending on the product.""")

- any data owner is always allowed to extend his [SecureDelegation] or its children (according to the hierarchy specified
by the [parentDelegations]).
- any data owner can create new [SecureDelegation] to share an entity he can access with other data owners, but he can
only give equivalent or lower permissions.
Top level delegations must not specify any permissions, as any top-level delegation implicitly has full-write-permissions.
All other delegations instead must specify at least a permission.
The full syntax of permissions is to be defined, currently only "*" is allowed as a key, meaning all entries: essentially
currently it is only possible to give full-read-permissions or full-write-permissions. This should allow for a smoother
transition when fine-grained permissions will be implemented.""", required = true)
