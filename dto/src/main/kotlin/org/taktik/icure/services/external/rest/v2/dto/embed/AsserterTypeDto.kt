/**
 * The kind of entity a health element asserter's [HealthElementAsserterDto.LocalAsserterIdentifier.id] refers to.
 *
 * This is the *entity-kind* axis, not the role axis: it says what sort of record the id points at, not what part the
 * party played in the assertion. Do not confuse it with ParticipantTypeDto.
 *
 * It applies to the *local* branch of [HealthElementAsserterDto] only: an asserter named by
 * [HealthElementAsserterDto.externalAsserterIdentifier] has no record here, so it carries no entity kind.
 *
 * The entries deliberately mirror [PartnerTypeDto], which answers the same question for a partnership's partnerId. The
 * two enums are kept separate on purpose: partnership vocabulary and asserter vocabulary are free to diverge, and
 * neither should widen because the other did.
 *
 * Note that an organisation (hospital, practice, care home, ...) is not a distinct entry: organisations are stored as
 * healthcare party records, so they use [healthcareParty].
