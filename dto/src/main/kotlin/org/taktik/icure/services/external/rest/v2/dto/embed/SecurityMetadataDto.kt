This map is useful in cases when it is not possible to know for certain if the delegate of a new secure delegation will be able
to produce the access control key we are planning to use. For example the access control key may be produced by a combination of
access control secret and secret foreign key of the entity: what happens if the entity has multiple secret foreign keys? The
delegate may have access to only one of them but not all, so if we chose an unlucky secret foreign key in the creation of the
access control key the delegate will never be able to access the entity. This field allows to essentially create an access control
key and corresponding secure delegation key for each secret foreign key without having to replicate the actual secure delegation.""")
