/**
 * Represents an entity where access control is granted to specific users instead of or in addition to all users with a specific role.
 * The id of users with access to the entity is explicitly indicated in the entity itself, but it is possible that some additional users
 * have access to the entity without being explicitly indicated in the entity (see [HasSecureDelegationsAccessControl]).
 * Note that user-based access control may not apply to all methods for an entity, and in some cases a user role may provide a higher
 * access level compared to the user-specific level, but in all cases only users which were given explicit access to the encryption key of
 * an entity will be able to read the encrypted data.
