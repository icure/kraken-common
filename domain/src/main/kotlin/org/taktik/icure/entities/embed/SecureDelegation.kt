/**
 * Represents a delegation which allows a data owner to access the encrypted data of an entity and specifies his access control level.
 * The encrypted  metadata is created by a "delegator" data owner, and can be used also by a "delegate" data owner. To create new
 * [SecureDelegation] the "delegate" and "delegator" data owners must have created some [ExchangeData]: their [ExchangeData.exchangeKey]
 * is used for the encryption of the content of this delegation, while its [ExchangeData.accessControlSecret] is used for creating the key
 * of [SecurityMetadata.secureDelegations].
 *
 * New [SecureDelegation] will be created in two situations:
 * - When a data owner creates a new entity he will also add [SecureDelegation] where he is both delegator and delegate.
 * - When a data owner wants to share an entity with another data owner he will create new [SecureDelegation] where he
 * is the delegator and the other data owner is the delegate.
 *
 * ## Optionally explicit delegator and delegate
 *
 * The [SecureDelegation] can optionally include explicitly the id of the [delegator] and [delegate] data owners using the
 * respective fields:
 * - When the id of a data owner is explicit the server can know at any moment which users have access to which data. This
 * allows to more easily search for all data that a specific user can access, as access control rights can be checked easily
 * by the server. At the same time, however, this could break confidentiality of the data, because for example knowing that
 * a patient has access to some medical data means that the data is likely about that patient or a close relative, and if
 * the data includes some unencrypted codes this may leak medical information for the patient.
 * - When the id of a data owner is not explicit the data owner will have to know beforehand the access control key to be used
 * for access control, as the server does not have a way of knowing who is the delegator and/or delegate of the secure delegation.
 * A user with only a few instances of exchange data can easily load all his access control keys and pass them to the api method,
 * but this may not be possible for hcps, as they could have exchange data with many of their patients.
 * In general users will want to hide the delegator/delegate id for patient and medical devices data owners, in order to keep
 * data confidentiality. For hcps instead the best choice depends is likely to change depending on the product.
