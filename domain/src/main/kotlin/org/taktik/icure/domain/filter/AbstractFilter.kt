	 * This method returns true in one of two cases:
	 * - The filter is for an encryptable entity and includes any search for data that is not limited to data for a
	 *   (set of) specific data owner id(s) AND may leak information on the content of an entity.
	 * - The filter is for a non-encryptable entity but the filter intrinsically leaks redacted information.
	 * This could be for example the case if:
	 * - The filter is a composition (union/intersection) of other filters and in at least one of the sub-filters
	 *   [requiresSecurityPrecondition] returns true
	 * - The filter does not have a field for data-owner id (or it is optional and set to null, returning values for
	 *   all hcps) and allows to filter by codes or tags in the entity
	 * - An HCP filter that allows to filter by tag (the user could get the id of the HCP with a certain tag even
	 *   they do not have the permission to read the tags).
	 * Note that a filter "byIds" only will always have this value as false, since the only information it could "leak"
	 * is the id of the entity, already given in input to the filter.
	 *
	 * Note that even if [requestedDataOwnerIds] is  not empty this method may still return true.
